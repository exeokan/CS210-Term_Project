# Introduction

In this project, I am analzying my own Instagram data to learn how much I use the app through time, how do I interact with the content, and how do I do interact with my close circle. 

# Data Source

My personal Instagram data have been downloaded upon the request I made through the app itself. Downloaded package included JSON files containing various information. Instructions are available on the Instagram's website https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920.

I also prepared another dataset: number of assignments and exams I had per week in this semester (2023 Fall).

In order to relate it to the data I prepared, Instagram data is limited to after September 2023.
